## Installation hints

### Telnet
Telnet session on serial monitor (Arduino bridge):
use ssh-server tool to open ssh session. Type shortcut comand 'tn' to run script on /usr/bin.
Script must be copyied once from SD card folder wwww/TelnetLocalhost6571 by executing file 'runOnceTransferScript'
used SSH-Tools:
* PuTTY           .(Windows system :computer: )
* Serveraudithor  .(IOS devices :iphone: )

### SFTP-Server
the Linino package does nott come with SFTP support. But it can be installed via SSH session or via LuCI web interface (System/Software).

Within SSH session (like PuTTY) type in:
```C++
opkg update
opkg install openssh-sftp-server
```

SFTP service can than be used instandly (i.e. without booting the system) by using a SFTP programm (like FileZilla). Installed version of `\openssh-sftp-server`\ can be checked by using above mentioned LuCI web interface (System/Software/Installed Packages).
